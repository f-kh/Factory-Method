## Introduction
This project is designed to share what I have learned with others. Includes two simple code example of factory method design pattern in php. Codes example has been written in the Laravel Framework and also tested with unit testing. 

## What is Factory Method? 
The Factory Method is a Creational design pattern. That is used when we have defined several PHP classes, but we want to create an access and prototype of those classes so that we can use that method to create a sample of those classes. In fact, the name of the factory is due to the fact that we can create objects of classes without having information about the steps and how they are made.

## Explain the sample code
Here are two simple examples. One is in the log folder and the other is in the play folder. Their tests are also in the unit test folder with their own name.
